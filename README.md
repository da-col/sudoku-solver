# Sudoku Solver

This project is designed to show how to solve a basic 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. It will also compare running time between different solving algorithms. The first algorithm is an unoptimized version that solves the puzzle in almost worst-case time. Additional solving algorithms will be added to demonstrate improvements in run time.

React, Redux and Redux Toolkit are the primary libraries/state containers used for this project.
